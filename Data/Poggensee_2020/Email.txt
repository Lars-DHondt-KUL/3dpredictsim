Hi Maarten,

That sounds great! I'm happy to provide data.

1. The subject's reported mass is 64 kg. I've also attached a .c3d file (static_shoes_full.c3d), which probably has a more accurate mass measurement as well.
2. The mass of one exoskeleton is 0.88 kg. A quick estimate of the inertial properties is easiest if the device is split into two segments: the foot segment (foot_cad.png) and the calf segment (calf_cad.png). The center of mass of the foot segment is about 1.5 inches below the ankle joint, and the center of mass of the calf segment is 4.5 inches above the ankle and a little over 1.5 inches behind the midline of the shank (in the anteroposterior direction). The principal moments of inertia for the foot are [7.32; 17.02; 23.25] lbs*in^2 and for the calf are [24.91; 22.69; 9.32] lbs*in^2, where the axes are [forward in the direction of walking; to the left; up]. Here is a picture of the device on the person for reference.
3. The torque profile is [0.544*mass in kg; 52.91; 26.16; 9.76] in the parameterization in our original HiLO paper, but I've also attached an image (torque_profile.jpg) and a .mat file (torque_profile.mat), as a % of stride and in Nm/kg.
4. All subjects walked at 1.25 m/s.

We will have motion capture, ground reaction forces, and EMG for validation with and without the exoskeleton on and with and without the exoskeleton applying assistance. We're still processing that data, but we should be done by the time you've finished the simulations.

I'm sorry for the slow response; I was sick this past week, but I'll be much more responsive in the future if you have any questions or concerns.

Best,
Katie
